## Hey there 👋

I'm currently working at [smallcase](https://smallcase.com) as a Backend Engineer

I was [Google Summer of Code 2019 student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5362213500485632/
) and mentor for the year 2020 😄

I love nature and the road trips that take me closer to it, always ready for another ⛰ 🌏
